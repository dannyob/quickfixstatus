Quickfixstatus
==================

Using Vim's quickfix windows, or location lists usually involves opening them
in a separate window, and using :cnext or its equivalents to page through the
messages.

This plugin shows checks whether the current line in a buffer is in its local
location list, the global quickfix list, or the
[Syntastic](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2736) plugin's list
of syntax errors. If it is, it displays the connected error message at the
bottom of the screen, where command line messages are displayed. (Technically,
this isn't Vim's status line, it's the command line buffer, but it's certainly
where status messages often appear.)

Commands:

`:QuickfixStatusEnable` -- turns on the feature globally

`:QuickfixStatusDisable` -- turns off the feature globally
